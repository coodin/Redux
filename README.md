# vite-template-redux

The main inspiration in here was to learn lastest Redux features that it provides and there are a lot of things to consider
some of them are how can I create slices or how to make http request with asynThunk and how can I send actions with dispatch using typescript, all of them are was basic of how Redux work but main API that I am amazed is RTK Query because it offers so many things that requires less work according to other basics, I don't want to dive in because it has a lot of things inside so you can check out what I did.

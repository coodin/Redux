# vite-template-redux

The main inspiration in here was to learn lastest Redux features that it provides and there are a lot of things to consider
some of them are how can I create slices or how to make http request with asynThunk and how can I send actions with dispatch using typescript, all of them are was basic of how Redux work but main API that I am amazed is RTK Query because it offers so many things that requires less work according to other basics, I don't want to dive in because it has a lot of things inside so you can check out what I did.

<!-- Uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), and [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) to create a modern [React](https://react.dev/) app compatible with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) -->

<!--
```sh
npx degit reduxjs/redux-templates/packages/vite-template-redux my-app
``` -->

<!-- ## Goals

- Easy migration from Create React App or Vite
- As beginner friendly as Create React App
- Optimized performance compared to Create React App
- Customizable without ejecting -->

//## Scripts

<!-- - `dev`/`start` - start dev server and open browser
- `build` - build for production
- `preview` - locally preview production build
- `test` - launch test runner -->

//## Inspiration

<!-- - [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/main/packages/cra-template)
- [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react)
- [Vitest](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/tree/main/examples/react-testing-lib) -->
